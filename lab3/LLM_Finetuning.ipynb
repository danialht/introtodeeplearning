We can split the text into individual chunks, and then map these chunks to numerical tokens -- collectively this is the process of [tokenization](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tokenizer_summary). Numerical tokens can then be fed into a language model.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Subword tokenization**: breaks words into smaller units (subwords) based on their frequency. The most popular and commonly used approach is [byte-pair encoding (BPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding), which iteratively merges the most frequent character pairs. Modern language models typically use subword tokenization as it balances vocabulary size and sequence length while handling unknown words effectively by breaking them into known subword units.\n",

    "Fine-tuning is a technique that allows us to adapt a pre-trained neural network to better suit a downstream task, domain, or style, by training the model further on new data. By training the model further on a carefully curated dataset, we can modify its behavior, style, or capabilities. Fine-tuning is used in a variety of applications, not just language modeling. But in language modeling, fine-tuning can be used to:\n",

The forward pass gives us the logits -- which reflect the probability distribution over the next token -- for the next token. We can compute the loss by comparing the predicted logits to the true next token -- our target label. Note that this is effectively a classification problem! So, our loss can be captured by the cross entropy loss, and we can use PyTorch's [`nn.functional.cross_entropy`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.html) function to compute it."

Benchmarks are also limited in the scope of tasks they can cover and capabilities they can reflect, and there can be concerns about whether the data in the benchmark was used to train the model. Synthetic data generation and synthetic tasks are a way to address these limitations, and this is an active area of research.\n",

In this lab, we will use a technique called [LLM as a judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685) to do exactly this. This involves using a larger LLM to score the outputs of a smaller LLM. The larger LLM is used as a judge, and it is given a system prompt that describes the task we want the smaller LLM to perform and the judging criteria. A \"system prompt\" is a way to set the general context and guide an LLM's behavior. Contextualized with this system prompt, the judge LLM can score the outputs of the smaller LLM, and we can use this score to evaluate how well the smaller LLM is doing."

Since it is infeasible to load larger models locally into notebooks, you will gain experience interfacing with these larger LLMs through an API served on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). \n",

Come to office hours to receive your credit. \n",

    "Through the OpenRouter interface, you will be able to experiment with different judge LLMs -- here we have suggested two possible larger LLMs to get you started: [Liquid AI's](https://www.liquid.ai/) [LFM-40B](https://openrouter.ai/models/liquid-ai/lfm-40b) andGoogle's [Gemma 9B](https://openrouter.ai/models/google/gemma-9b). Note there are also free models available on OpenRouter (e.g., [gemma-2-9b-it:free](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemma-2-9b-it:free)), but these will run into rate limitations if you run them too much.\n",

Note that the judge LLM and the metric can be applied to any text, not just the outputs of the model.
